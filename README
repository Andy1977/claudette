                    ColDet - 3D Collision Detection Library
                         Copyright (C) 2000  Amir Geva


DESCRIPTION

ColDet is a 3D collision detection library, intended for games.
It supports generic polyhedra, and even polygon soups.

As ColDet is no longer actively maintained, FougSys decided to fork the project to
keep it up to date :
  * ensure source code builds with recent C/C++ compilers
  * use GitHub as main project infrastructure

REQUIREMENTS

It is written in standard C++ and can be compiled on Windows or GNU/Linux systems

Other systems that have g++ will probably compile with no modification.
The code is portable to any system with a standard C++ compliant compiler
(as compliant as they get)

INSTALLATION

FougColdet can be built with various build systems:
  QMake:
    * Go in build/qmake
    * Optionally read fougcoldet.pro to figure out how to customize build
    * qmake && make

  GNU make:
    The original makefile provided by ColDet to build on Unix/gcc is still available:
    * Go in build/old
    * make -f makefile.g++

  Visual C++:
    The original coldet.dsp VC6 project is still provided in build/vc++
    You will also find a project/solution files for VC++ 2010

about it so that we can fix it. The FougColDet bug tracking system is
open to the public at https://github.com/fougsys/fougcoldet/issues.

Before reporting a bug, please use the bug-tracker's search functions
to see if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of FougColDet you are using, and
what options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run.
